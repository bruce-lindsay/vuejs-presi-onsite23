  <h1>What we love about Vue</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>formalizes how the front end code is composed</li>
    <li>less boilerplate than React</li>
    <li>Vue templates more ergonomic than JSX</li>
    <li>Doesn't require complex tool chain to get started with Vue</li>
    <li>Component libraries (BootStrapVue)</li>
    <li>native dom event convenience handlers</li>
    <li>Two way data binding in components</li>
    <li>
      vue is great because in general its been so simple that there isn't even
      much interesting I have to say about it.<br/> a dummy like me picked it up and understood
      it in like days
